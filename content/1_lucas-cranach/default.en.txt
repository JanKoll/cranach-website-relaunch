      paragraphmultitext: "Lucas Cranach the Elder embodies the ideals of Renaissance man active not only as a painter and printmaker, but also as an entrepreneur and politician. Little can be stated with any certainty about his early life except that he was born in the town of Kronach in Northern Franconia as one of four children to the painter Hans Maler and that his mother's maiden name was Hübner. His exact birth date is unknown, but it was probably in the year 1472. A portrait from 1550 (now in the Uffizi, Florence) bearing an authentic inscription that claims the sitter to be Cranach the Elder aged 77, provides evidence which corresponds with the accounts of the artist's cousin and first biographer, Matthias Gunderam in 1556."

      paragraphmultitext: "His early artistic training remains equally obscure. It is known that he was apprenticed to his father Hans, in Kronach, where he learned the crafts of the ars graphica and presumably the art of painting. Insufficient documentation has led to much speculation about his Wanderjahre - years of travel - and real evidence with regard to his artistic identity does not emerge until 1502 in Vienna. It is here that he assumes the name Lucas Cranach after his birth place, and begins to employ the initials 'LC'. Although this period was brief, less than two years in fact, his close association with a circle of humanist writers, particularly Johannes Cuspinian, proved to be formative."

        In the year 1505 Cranach was appointed
        court painter to Friedrich III the Wise,
        Elector of Saxony, a position he
        occupied almost uninterrupted until his
        death. He moved to Wittenberg where his
        duties not only included the production
        of paintings, engravings and woodcuts
        but also entailed everything from the
        design and execution of decorative
        schemes to the supervision of craftsmen
        as well as the embellishment of
        weddings, tournaments and other court
        celebrations. In short Cranach was
        responsible for almost the entire
        aesthetic ambience of the court. To meet
        these extensive demands he established a
        workshop, which was initially in
        Wittenberg castle and later moved to
        premises in the town.

        In 1508 the elector awarded him the
        heraldic letter bearing the symbol of a
        winged serpent. At an early stage
        Cranach began to identify his artistic
        production with the court and employed
        this insignia as a seal of approval on
        paintings produced by himself and his
        expanding workshop. That same year he
        journeyed in diplomatic service of the
        elector to the Netherlands where he
        visited the court of Margaret of Austria
        in Mechelen. Here he met the Holy Roman
        Emperor Maximilian I at the oath
        ceremony of his successor the
        eight-year-old Archduke Charles, later
        Charles V. Some years later Maximilian I
        commissioned Cranach together with the
        artist Albrecht Dürer to illustrate his
        prayer book.

        Cranach soon became a man of status in
        the city of Wittenberg and began to
        prosper, a situation, which was not
        achieved by artistic activity alone, but
        also by his talent as a businessman. By
        the 1520s he had a licence to sell wine,
        had been repeatedly elected as a member
        of the Wittenberg town council, and was
        owner of numerous properties, a
        publishing press (together with
        Christian Döring) and an apothecary. In
        1523 he hosted King Christian II of
        Denmark as a guest in his home and a
        year later he accompanied the elector to
        the Reichstag in Nuremberg where he
        again met his friend and rival Albrecht
        Dürer.

        As an artist Cranach is known for his
        portraits of German nobility and the
        leading figures of the Protestant
        Reformation, whose cause he embraced
        with enthusiasm. He became a close
        friend of Martin Luther, serving as best
        man at his wedding and later godfather
        to his son. Numerous portraits of Luther
        and his wife Katharina von Bora survive
        and testify to this sympathy. In his
        workshop Cranach printed reformation
        texts and Luther’s translation of the
        New Testament. Later, inspired by his
        friend and mentor Melanchthon, he
        explored new ways of conveying Lutheran
        religious concerns. Cranach’s artistic
        activity had a significant influence on
        the evolution of the Reformation in
        Germany. In addition to numerous
        paintings illustrating protestant
        concerns Cranach also completed
        paintings in the catholic tradition and
        numbered the catholic Albertine branch
        of Saxon princes and Cardinal Albrecht
        of Brandenburg among his most important
        patrons.

        From the mid 1520s the size and
        productivity of the Wittenberg workshop
        increased. Cranach developed techniques,
        which enabled him to paint speedily, and
        procedures of standardization that
        facilitated easy workshop delegation.
        Consequently many works now exist in
        different versions. In the 1530s Cranach
        cultivated a taste for subjects drawn
        from mythology and like his interest in
        religious subjects this continued
        throughout his career. At this stage
        both his sons Hans (c.1513-1537) and
        Lucas Cranach the Younger (1515-1586)
        were active members of the workshop
        enterprise.

        Cranach lost his position as court
        painter after the defeat of the Elector
        Johann Friedrich I at the Battle of
        Mühlberg in 1547. In 1550 he followed
        his master, who had been imprisoned by
        the Emperor Charles V in Augsburg and
        Innsbruck, into captivity. It was here
        that he met the Italian artist Titian,
        an encounter which was too late in his
        career to influence his work. Johann
        Friedrich was liberated in 1552 and
        reinstated as duke of Thuringia. He
        returned north to settle in Weimar, with
        Cranach at his side. A year later, on
        the 16th of October, Cranach died. His
        gravestone, which has now been installed
        in the chancel of the church of Saints
        Peter and Paul in Weimar, accurately
        describes him as ‘pictor
        celerrimus’, the fastest painter.

        The workshop enterprise outlived him,
        and his extraordinary artistic
        creativity is accentuated by the fact
        that his son Lucas Cranach the Younger,
        and other members, continued to create
        versions of his works for decades after
        his death. Today the success of the
        enterprise can be measured in more than
        1500 surviving paintings and the
        difficulty in securing authorship of the
        highest quality works.
